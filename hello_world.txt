Hello world?
Trying out some more functions. When do I stage (git add)?
I add the above line before adding/staging and this line was added after. 
That registered as two separate things: 'changes to be commited' and 'changes not staged for commit'. 
Now, I added/staged the file again and commited, then edited it again to explain it here, and now i'll add it again.
